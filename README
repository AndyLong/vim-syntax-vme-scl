This collection of files creates a syntax recognition system for the System
Control Language, running on the ICL/Fujitsu VME operating system. 

The files in the 'template' folder are designed to be used with Luc Hermitte's
version of Gergely Kontra's mu-template system.

*** NOTE: These files are sill under development ***

'foldmethod' is set to syntax, and you can select folding to be carried out on
a number of different syntactic constructs:-

1. Variable Declarations
2. Variable Assignments
3. Things in parentheses
4. IF/UNLESS-THEN-ELSF-THEN-ELSE-FI
5. WHENEVER-THEN-FI
6. DO-REPEAT
7. (PROC/MAC)BEGIN/END

If you want to experiment with it, then a number of buffer-local variables drive
the clauses that can be folded :-

b:scl_fold_declarations, b:scl_fold_assignments, b:scl_fold_parentheses,
b:scl_fold_body, b:scl_fold_blocks, b:scl_fold_loops & b:scl_fold_conditionals

which will inherit value from global variables of the same name, if set.
